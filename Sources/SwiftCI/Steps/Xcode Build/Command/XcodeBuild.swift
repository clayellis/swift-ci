// DESTINATIONS

/*

 Some actions (such as building) may be performed without an actual device present.  To build against a platform generically instead of a specific device, the destination specifier may be prefixed with the optional string "generic/", indicating that the platform should be targeted
 generically.  An example of a generic destination is the "Any iOS Device" destination displayed in Xcode's UI when no physical iOS device is present.

Testing on Multiple Destinations
 When more than one destination is specified with the -destination option, xcodebuild tests on those destinations concurrently. In this mode, xcodebuild automatically chooses the number of devices and simulators that are used simultaneously. All enabled tests in the scheme or xctestrun
 file are run on each destination.

Distributing Archives
 The -exportArchive option specifies that xcodebuild should distribute the archive specified by -archivePath using the options specified by -exportOptionsPlist.  xcodebuild -help can print the full set of available inputs to -exportOptionsPlist.  The product can either be uploaded to
 Apple or exported locally. The exported product will be placed at the path specified by -exportPath.

 Archives that have been uploaded to the Apple notary service can be distributed using the -exportNotarizedApp option. This specifies that xcodebuild should export a notarized app from the archive specified by -archivePath and place the exported product at the path specified by
 -exportPath.  If the archive has not completed processing by the notary service, or processing failed, then xcodebuild will exit and emit informational or error messages.

 When uploading an archive using the -exportArchive option, or exporting a notarized archive using the -exportNotarizedApp option, an Apple ID account belonging to the archive's development team is required. Enter the credentials for the Apple ID account using Xcode's Accounts
 preference pane before invoking xcodebuild.

Environment Variables
 The following environment variables affect the execution of xcodebuild:

 XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE
                     Set to a path to a file, build settings in that file will be loaded and used when building all targets.  These settings will override all other settings, including settings passed individually on the command line, and those in the file passed with the -xcconfig
                     option.

 TEST_RUNNER_<VAR>   Set an environment variable whose name is prefixed with TEST_RUNNER_ to have that variable passed, with its prefix stripped, to all test runner processes launched during a test action. For example, TEST_RUNNER_Foo=Bar xcodebuild test ... sets the environment
                     variable Foo=Bar in the test runner's environment. Existing variables may be modified using the special token __CURRENT_VALUE__ to represent their current value. For example, TEST_RUNNER_Foo=__CURRENT_VALUE__:Bar appends the string :Bar to any existing value of
                     Foo.

Exit Codes
 xcodebuild exits with codes defined by sysexits(3).  It will exit with EX_OK on success.  On failure, it will commonly exit with EX_USAGE if any options appear malformed, EX_NOINPUT if any input files cannot be found, EX_IOERR if any files cannot be read or written, and EX_SOFTWARE if
 the commands given to xcodebuild fail.  It may exit with other codes in less common scenarios.

/*

 EXAMPLES
      xcodebuild clean install

               Cleans the build directory; then builds and installs the first target in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started.

      xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -target Target1 -target Target2 -configuration Debug

               Builds the targets Target1 and Target2 in the project MyProject.xcodeproj using the Debug configuration.

      xcodebuild -target MyTarget OBJROOT=/Build/MyProj/Obj.root SYMROOT=/Build/MyProj/Sym.root

               Builds the target MyTarget in the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started, putting intermediate files in the directory /Build/MyProj/Obj.root and the products of the build in the directory /Build/MyProj/Sym.root.

      xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.6

               Builds the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild was started against the macOS 10.6 SDK.  The canonical names of all available SDKs can be viewed using the -showsdks option.

      xcodebuild -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme

               Builds the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace.

      xcodebuild archive -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme

               Archives the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace.

      xcodebuild build-for-testing -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination generic/platform=iOS

               Build tests and associated targets in the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using the generic iOS device destination. The command also writes test parameters from the scheme to an xctestrun file in the built products directory.

      xcodebuild test-without-building -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 5s' -destination 'platform=iOS,name=My iPad'

               Tests the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using both the iOS Simulator and the device named iPhone 5s for the latest version of iOS. The command assumes the test bundles are in the build root (SYMROOT).  (Note that the shell requires arguments
               to be quoted or otherwise escaped if they contain spaces.)

      xcodebuild test-without-building -xctestrun MyTestRun.xctestrun -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 5s' -destination 'platform=iOS,name=My iPad'

               Tests using both the iOS Simulator and the device named iPhone 5s.  Test bundle paths and other test parameters are specified in MyTestRun.xctestrun.  The command requires project binaries and does not require project source code.

      xcodebuild test -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64'

               Tests the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using the destination described as My Mac 64-bit in Xcode.

      xcodebuild test -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64' -only-testing MyTests/FooTests/testFooWithBar

               Tests the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace using the destination described as My Mac 64-bit in Xcode. Only the test testFooWithBar of the test suite FooTests, part of the MyTests testing bundle target, will be run.

      xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath MyMobileApp.xcarchive -exportPath ExportDestination -exportOptionsPlist 'export.plist'

               Exports the archive MyMobileApp.xcarchive to the path ExportDestination using the options specified in export.plist.

      xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -project MyProject.xcodeproj -localizationPath MyDirectory -exportLanguage zh-hans -exportLanguage es-MX

               Exports two XLIFF files to MyDirectory from MyProject.xcodeproj containing development language strings and translations for Simplified Chinese and Mexican Spanish.

      xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -project MyProject.xcodeproj -localizationPath MyDirectory

               Export a single XLIFF file to MyDirectory from MyProject.xcodeproj containing only development language strings. (In this case, the -exportLanguage parameter has been excluded.)

      xcodebuild -importLocalizations -project MyProject.xcodeproj -localizationPath MyLocalizations.xliff

               Imports localizations from MyLocalizations.xliff into MyProject.xcodeproj.  Translations with issues will be reported but not imported.
